# Chord-Detection-AI

This project integrates a model trained to detect musical chords with an Arduino-based LED display. The Python package, built for musical key detection, processes input audio to identify specific chords. Python code handles the communication between the model and an Arduino, which controls an 7 segment display to visually represent the key.

Required:
VSCode (Or anything that can run python code.), 
Arduino starter kit (mega 2560), 
A microphone,
