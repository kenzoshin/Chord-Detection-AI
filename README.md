# Chord-Detection-AI

This project integrates a Google Teachable Machine model trained to detect musical chords with an Arduino-based LED display. The Teachable Machine model, trained on audio samples of various chords, processes input audio to identify specific chords. Python code handles the communication between the model and an Arduino, which controls an LED display to visually represent the key.

Required:
Google teachable machine, 
VSCode (Or anything that can run python code.), 
Arduino starter kit (mega 2560), 
A microphone
